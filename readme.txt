Automatically redirects users between mobile and desktop versions of your site based on their device type.

== Description ==

Responsive Redirect is a WordPress plugin that allows you to create conditional redirects based on device type (mobile, tablet, or desktop). This helps optimize user experience by directing visitors to the most suitable version of your site or content.

**How It Works:**
- Mobile users visiting `example.com` are **automatically redirected** to `example.com/mobile`.
- If a mobile user switches to desktop, they are **redirected back** to `example.com`.
- This ensures an optimized browsing experience tailored to each user's device.

**Key Features:**
- Fully compatible with modern WordPress versions.
- **Automatic Mobile/Desktop redirection** â€“ based on device type.
- **Two-Way Redirection** â€“ Ensures users always view the correct version.
- **Custom Redirect Rules** â€“ Define your own conditions for specific pages or users.
- Support for mobile, tablet, and desktop redirection.
- Simple configuration in the WordPress admin panel.
- Lightweight and performance-friendly.
